# Website_Green
A static website for a hostel/PG/housing.
>>The theme revolves around a green more vibrant  living space that matches/resoantes with the enviornment where the housing is.

/ the idea for the project is to either give a rugged or a soothing vibe which both are very different and almost polar opposites as per my thoughts.

>>The Color theme will be green marble and walnut / Green and teracotta /.... honestly green and dark brown never goes wrong.
Incase or Triple material/color combinations
